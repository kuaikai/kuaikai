Abstract
--------

We propose a system for continuous evaluation of autonomous driving capabilities
in high-speed racetracks. In the first implementation, the vehicles used on the
racetrack will be small (1/16 or 1/10 of full-size). User-submitted controllers
are evaluated remotely on real cars that can complete a racetrack circuit. Lap
times are saved to a leaderboard that ranks submissions according to best
(smallest) times. Potential users must pass simulation tests and, then,
hardware-in-the-loop simulations, before being granted time with the real cars
on the racetrack.
