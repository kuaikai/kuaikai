# 快·开 (kuai kai)

## Abstract

We propose a system for continuous evaluation of autonomous driving capabilities
in high-speed racetracks. In the first implementation, the vehicles used on the
racetrack will be small (1/16 or 1/10 of full-size). User-submitted controllers
are evaluated remotely on real cars that can complete a racetrack circuit. Lap
times are saved to a leaderboard that ranks submissions according to best
(smallest) times. Potential users must pass simulation tests and, then,
hardware-in-the-loop simulations, before being granted time with the real cars
on the racetrack.

## Websites

Documentation releases are available at
https://kuaikai.readthedocs.io/

## Organization

Each directory that contains the source code of a major component will have a
README that introduces it.

* `acarbroker`: Web app for receiving user submissions and evaluating them in
  pure simulation and, then, hardware-in-the-loop simulation.

* `cars`: source code for support of specific car models.

* `doc`: sources for the user guide, developer guide, references, implementation
  details about hardware-in-the-loop simulation, racetrack layout, etc.  The
  documentation is written using [reStructuredText](
  http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) and built with [Sphinx](
  https://sphinx.readthedocs.io/).
